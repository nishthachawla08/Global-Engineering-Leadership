# Global-Engineering-Leadership
The above files were submitted as part of coursework for APSC 461- Global Engineering Leadership. The purpose of the report is to present the problem statement, methods used and findings of the study and make recommendations on how to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and divert it to recycling waste stream. This project engages the Riley Park South Cambie community members to consider the amount and type of waste that they produce and to consider steps that a family can realistically take to reduce the amount of material that it sends to the landfill.
